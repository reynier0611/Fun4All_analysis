# Fun4All analysis

This repository can be used to quickly analyze output root files from Fun4All in general, but specifically from [here](https://github.com/eic/g4lblvtx "EIC prototype All-Silicon tracker repository"). This repository is structured in two separate directories: 1) processing, and 2) analysis.

## processing

The first step is done in this repository. Codes here loop over root files expected to be found in a directory called **data**, which should be created inside the top directory. These codes produce secondary root files with extracted momentum, angular, vertex, ... resolutions.

The codes here should be run the following way:

```
./code_name A B C filename.root config.txt
where:
A = 1 -> Widths from table will be used
  = 2 -> Widths from table won't be used
B = 1 -> Table will be updated
  = 2 -> Table won't be updated
C = 1 -> Run code and quit
  = 2 -> Run code and show plots
The files 'filename.root' and 'config.txt' are expected to be in the directories '../data' and 'config' respectively
```

## analysis

The second step is to write codes in this directory to analyze and plot the secondary root files produced in the **processing** step.
